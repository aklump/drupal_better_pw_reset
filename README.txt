              Better Password Reset Drupal Module Better Pw Reset

Summary

   When a user registers an account and clicks on the log in link, they
   are presented with their user edit page. This can be overwhelming for
   new users. The important action is that they create a password. The
   rest of their profile is secondary to this one event. This module
   presents an interim form, which asks for one thing: their password. In
   this way it improves the reset password experience for users, by asking
   them for the precise information that is needed.

   The other scenario this module handles is when an existing user
   requests a new password. The same process as described above applies
   here as well.

   My hope is that this reduces confusion and frustration and creates a
   better experience overall for Drupal users.

Installation

    1. Install this module as you would any other.

Usage

    1. Request a new password.
    2. Click on the email link.
    3. Notice the interim form presented to the user.
