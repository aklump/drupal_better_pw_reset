<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>When a user registers an account and clicks on the log in link, they are presented with their user edit page.  This can be overwhelming for new users.  The important action is that they create a password.  The rest of their profile is secondary to this one event.  This module presents an interim form, which asks for one thing: their password.  In this way it improves the reset password experience for users, by asking them for the precise information that is needed.</p>

<p>The other scenario this module handles is when an existing user requests a new password.  The same process as described above applies here as well.</p>

<p>My hope is that this reduces confusion and frustration and creates a better experience overall for Drupal users.</p>
